# Blot Files
## Installation
#### Arch Linux
1. Build the package. `makepkg` should suffice.
2. Install the package. `pacman -U [build result]` will do this.
3. Run `pyblot`.
#### Conventional
Run `install.sh` as root (if necessary) with the argument -l if you have a light background, or -d if you have a dark one.
